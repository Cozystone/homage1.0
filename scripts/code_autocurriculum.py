"""Code self-curriculum runner (owner 2026-07-13: " ").

Runs the autonomous code curriculum so the engine's coding capability advances WITHOUT a human
adding primitives or writing targets. Each round the engine invents its own problems (composing its
verified library), solves + generalizes them, dedups by behavior (keeps the smallest program per
FUNCTION, rejects trivial/bloated ones), and the controller self-paces difficulty (climb on
mastery+saturation, ease off when a tier is too hard). Progress accrues in a journal the owner can
watch — no code editing between advances.

Two modes:
 python scripts/code_autocurriculum.py --once 8 # run 8 rounds now, print + exit (on-demand)
 python scripts/code_autocurriculum.py # bounded daemon: a burst every INTERVAL sec

OPT-IN by design. This is NOT auto-started by the watchdog (the diet-flood lesson: no new always-on
CPU burner without ops control). Singleton (port lock 18793). Offline-only: it writes just
runtime/evolution/curriculum_state.json + curriculum_journal.jsonl; it never touches the stores,
answer packs, or the engine process, so it can never regress P0.
