"""SPLATRA point-cloud detail — abstract disks → recognizable object silhouettes (owner's 2026-07-12
" " order). A concept becomes a STRUCTURAL FORM (a tree branches, a bottle is a vessel,
a person is humanoid) instead of a uniform blob, so "" materializes tree-shaped behind the glass.

Two truths kept honest:
 * this is the PIPELINE + a structural bootstrap — the forms are procedural silhouettes keyed by the
 graph's TYPE (a presentation vocabulary, like the blob/swirl archetypes, not a per-concept table);
 * a real learned 3DGS asset drops into the SAME pipeline: `decimate_importance` reduces its Gaussians
 to the output budget, and the renderer draws that instead of the procedural form. Not faked as trained.

RESOURCE SAFETY (owner's design question) lives at the engine's mouth — never stream raw Gaussians to a
2D canvas. `lod_budget` bounds points-per-object by depth × salience under a hard per-frame ceiling; the
renderer's frame-time governor scales it down further under load. The wire carries a tiny SHAPE SPEC
(form + seed + params), not points — the bounded cloud is generated client-side where the frame budget
is measured.
